Painful errors so that I don't have to re google

-on the main url.py page needs to use the patterns function, not define a tuple
-don't apply EOL to a string, won't parse properly

-find correct way to place templates directory
'DIRS': [TEMPLATE_PATH,], where template path is 'path'

-serving static media from the static folder, cool
